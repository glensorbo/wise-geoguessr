## Rules

- **Must not** import from sibling feature folders.
- **Must** add shared chart/colour helpers to `constants.ts` — not inline in components.
- `useResults.ts` is the single source for year-state + fetch logic — reuse it, don't duplicate.
- `useRoundDetail.ts` is the single source for per-round fetch + derivation logic — reuse it, don't duplicate.
- `usePlayerProfile.ts` is the single source for per-player stats, rank history, streak, and achievements — reuse it, don't duplicate.
- `getPlayerSparklineData` filters to played rounds only — never pass raw scores containing `null`/absent entries to a chart.
